# pipescroll.js

Everyone falls. And now your pipes can too.
### Setup:

1. Include "pipescroll.js" in your page.
2. Initialize the pipescroll plugin once the DOM has loaded:

```javascript
// Metal pipe every 400 pixels scrolled
pipescroll(); 

// Metal pipe every 800 pixels scrolled
pipescroll(800);
```
